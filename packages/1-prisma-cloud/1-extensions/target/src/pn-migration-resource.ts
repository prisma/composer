/**
 * The `PnMigration` Alchemy resource (ADR-0022, slice 2 D2) — the migration
 * step modeled as a tracked resource so it participates in deploy state: keyed
 * on the target REF identity (`targetHash` + sorted `invariants`), an
 * unchanged redeploy is an Alchemy-level no-op (on top of the marker read),
 * and a contract change — or a DATA-ONLY change that adds a ref invariant at
 * the same hash — re-runs the migration.
 *
 * Its provider's `reconcile` receives the RESOLVED props at apply-time — in
 * particular the concrete DB `url` (a lazy `Output` until the Connection
 * provisions) — and delegates to the proven `applyPnMigration` decision. The
 * provider is a standalone `Provider<PnMigration>` layer; the extension
 * descriptor merges it into its `providers()` (`Layer.merge(Prisma.providers(),
 * PnMigrationProvider())`), and Alchemy resolves it at apply via a direct
 * provider-tag lookup (`tryFindProviderByType`) — no change to `@internal/lowering`.
 *
 * Deploy-time only: imports `@prisma-next/postgres/control` (via the helper) +
 * `alchemy`. Imported by `control.ts` and tests, never by `index.ts` / the
 * `./prisma-next` authoring entry — index isolation holds.
