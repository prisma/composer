/**
 * The extension's config serializer — the semantic↔physical mapping, private to
 * the extension, SHARED by run() (boot) and /control's serialize (deploy) so writer
 * and reader cannot drift.
 *
 * Keys are unique per service within the shared project namespace: the
 * serializer prefixes them with the deployment address (its segments after the app
 * root — empty for a lone-service deploy, the "unprefixed" case), then the
 * owner (the input name, dropped for the service's own params), then the
 * param name. auth's db.url ↔ AUTH_DB_URL; a lone service's db.url ↔ DB_URL.
 * The platform's DATABASE_URL is never among them — forbidden and poisoned
 * at project provision (see docs/design/05-prisma-cloud/alchemy-lowering.md).
 *
 * This module works off the node's RAW params (`node.params` and each
 * `node.inputs[k].connection.params`) rather than `configOf`'s pure-data
 * projection — it needs each param's `schema` to validate on the way in.
 *
 * Serialization is the target's, not the param's (ADR-0019). The rule is by
 * owner: a service's own params are literals, JSON-encoded; a dependency
 * input's params are provisioning refs at deploy (resolved strings at boot)
 * and pass through untouched, so a ref keeps carrying its ordering edge.
